# LSH-for-Product-Duplication
This project uses LSH to identify duplicate products among 1624 televisions based on their product titles.
The structure of the code is as follows:
Data preprocessing, creating the input matrix, performing minhashing, creating a signature matrix and performing LSH on this.
Following this evaluation measures are evaluated for different band lengths. 
Next Jaccard and Signature similarity are computed which are used as input measures for a classifier.

The code can be used with the json file containing the data of all televisions.
The code must be run in order as functions are created from top to bottom.
To adjust the number of bands the value of 50 in the following statement can be adjusted: all_bands = np.vsplit(signature_matrix,50)
Additionally, the threshold for classification is changed manually, currently set at 0.9.

Note: there is a bug in the code following the creation of the signature matrix. That is, the number of duplicates found by LSH remains the same 
irrespective of the number of bands used. This causes a significant problem in the evaluation and comparison of the results for LSH and also
classification.
